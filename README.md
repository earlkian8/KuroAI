# KuroAI Chatbot

KuroAI is a modern, responsive chatbot application built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, leveraging the **Gemini API** to provide intelligent and interactive chat functionalities. This project aims to deliver a seamless and user-friendly chat experience with a sleek, customizable interface.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Gemini API**: Provides the AI-powered chatbot functionality.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language for the application.

## Environment Variables
To integrate the Gemini API, you need to provide an API key. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```plaintext
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

- Obtain your API key from the Gemini API dashboard.
- Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent exposing your API key.
